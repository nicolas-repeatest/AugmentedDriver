Check [our 5 Minute Tutorial](http://augmenteddriver.salesforceiq.com/#what-is-augmented-driver) on how to use the tool.

Also, for more detailed information, the [Wiki](https://github.com/relateiq/AugmentedDriver/wiki/The-Basics) is available  

*** 

The whole framework aims to simplify 3 aspects of writing JAVA E2E tests using WebDriver/Appium:
* Easy configuration for running tests and suites of tests in different browsers/devices, and simple out of the box integrations with SauceLabs, Allure, Slack and with CI systems, such as TeamCity or Jenkins
* Design so you are encourage to follow the [Page Object Model](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects), and to encourage separation of concerns for modularizing your suite.
* A think layer on top of WebDriver/Appium with handy functionality that helps the development of tests, both in speed of development and also reliability of the tests.  

***  

With this framework, At SalesforceIQ we were able to run 250+ (and adding every week) E2E Tests for Web, Android and IOS in less than 15 minutes, 80000+ tests in one month, embedded in our TeamCity Integration with the help from SauceLabs
